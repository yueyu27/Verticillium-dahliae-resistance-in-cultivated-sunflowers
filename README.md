# Verticillium dahliae resistance in cultivated sunflowers
For manuscript: Genomic Insights into Disease Resistance in Sunflowers: Identifying Key Regions and Candidate Genes for Verticillium dahliae Resistance

There are seven sections of code included here:
Part 1: Preparing file and run GWA with EMMAX
Part 2: Plotting Manhattan plots with PAV and SNP data (initial)
Part 3: Preparing file and run rrBLUP to find candidate markers (Figure 1)
Part 4: Clump candidate markers into haploblocks based on LD
Part 5: Plotting Manhattan plots and highlighting identified candidate markers (Figure 1)
Part 6: Enrichment analyses: GO and KEGG
Part 7: Plotting validation experiment results for (Figure 2)
